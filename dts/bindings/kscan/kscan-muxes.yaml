  A generic binding for a GPIO-controlled blinking LED. Note that this binding
  has no vendor prefix, as it does not target a specific device or vendor.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    blink-gpio-led {
        compatible = "blink-gpio-led";
        led-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        blink-period-ms = <1000>;
    };

compatible: "kscan-muxes"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  muxes:
    type: phandle-array
    specifier-space: mux
    required: true
  mux-names:
    type: string-array
    required: false
    description: Optional names for the mux channels (debug only)
  io-channels:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: >
      List of ADC channels. Should be the same amount and in same order
      as corresponding multiplexors.
